# ‚ùó Definition
- $X(e^{jw}) = \sum_{n=-\infty}^\infty x[n]e^{-j\omega n}$
- For simple DTFTs of $a^n u[n]$
	- A decaying exponential that's useful for creating a filter
	- $X(e^{jw}) =$
	- When a is between 0 and 1, low pass
	- When a is between -1 and 0, high pass
	- Looking at the period from $-\pi$ to $\pi$, since it's digital it repeats
	- Highest frequency we can have in the digital domain is $\pi$
	-
