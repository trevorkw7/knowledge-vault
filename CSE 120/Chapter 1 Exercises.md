1. What is an operating system?
- In this class it is defined as the kernel which is the piece of software that interfaces directly with the hardware on one end and with running programs in the other

3. How does an operating system make the computer easier to use?*
- Through abstraction, we can let algorithm designers writing programs focus on the design portion instead of worrying about managing resources by creating the illusion of unlimited processes / memory

5. What is an example of a difficulty a user would have in using a computer

that had no operating system?**
- Would need to manage resources like CPU time, memory space, and the use of I/O devices
